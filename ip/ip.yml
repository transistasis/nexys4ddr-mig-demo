# This file allows the generation of IP and block design output products in Xilinx Vivado
# Note that in Non-Project Mode, all output products must be generated for IP and block designs before launching top-level synthesis (UG892).
#
# The following attributes can be used for each IP instance:
#   filetype        : Can be 'xci', 'xco'
#   pregenerated    : TRUE if output products have already been generated in the IP repository
#   disable_xdc     : If TRUE, .dcp generation will be disabled (this is used if you want to override IP constraints with top-level constraints) (UNTESTED!)
#   upgrade_ip      : If TRUE, the IP will be checked to see if a new version is available
#   generate_target : Allows the user to control which IP output products are generated (default: all)
#
# The following attributes can be used for each block design instance:
#   filetype        : Can be 'bd'
#   pregenerated    : TRUE if there is an existing block design with all output products intact (UG994)
